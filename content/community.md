Would you be interested in joining the Discord server of the Finnish DFIR community?

The DFIR-FI community has its own Discord server for TLP:CLEAR / TLP:GREEN information exchange. You can join the community with the invitation link hidden inside the [memdump.7z](https://files.dfir.fi/challenge/memdump.7z) challenge.

Hope to see you on Discord!
