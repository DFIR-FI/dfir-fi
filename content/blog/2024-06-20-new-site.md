## New year, new site

I have decided to merge my old sites [blog.dfir.fi](https://blog.dfir.fi) and [dfir.fi](https://dfir.fi) into one page. I will also be posting about the [DFIR-FI community](/community), news about my new [training](/training) courses, maintaining my [CV](/about/whois), and promoting [my services](/about/whois) on this site.

## Collaboration

At the same time as I launch the new site, I will also offer others the opportunity to post information on the site, both through the promotion of [their company's DFIR services](/) and [trainings](/training) and through [blog posts](/blog). I look forward to hearing from anyone who would like to write about their DFIR research, malware, training experiences or any training-related blog posts on this site.

## Disclaimer

As the owner of the site, I reserve the right to change the content of the site at my discretion. At the moment it feels good to offer the possibility for others to publish content on this site - in the future this may be different.
