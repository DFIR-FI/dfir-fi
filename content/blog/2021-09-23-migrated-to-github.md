I’ve decided to change my blog from self-hosted jekyll site to auto deployed Github hugo page.

Because of this, my blog’s RSS feed will also change. You can find the new RSS link from footer.

I will likely release more but less structured content on this blog in the future.

blog.dfir.fi CNAME will soon point to https://who1s.github.io
