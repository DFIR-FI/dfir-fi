This is a list of Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) companies in Finland. These companies can help you in case of a security incident. Purpose of this list is to give organizations a list of active DFIR companies.

Please note that this is a list of companies, who provide DFIR support for Finnish organizations. Companies offer services on a one-off basis (e.q. the customer does not have to have continuous agreement with the company to get help) or through an ongoing retainer agreement.

The companies have registered themselves on the list. The companies on the list have therefore not been validated by the site owner or any Finnish official.

To add your company to the list, see [Contribute](/contribute).
